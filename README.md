# generic-Linear-Search
A generic program for linear search to find an element using memory comparison.


This program provides best solution for generic linear search that helps you to search an element of any data type.
C++ programming language has templates that can be used to implement the generic functions but this is the best solution that C
can provide. Although this is not the most elegant solution but this is the best C can provide.

Moreover C++ template creates multiple object code for every data type in code during compile time. But this code creates only single 
entity in object code and searches the element using linear search of any type.
